python.exe
   The command "python.exe" refers to the Python executable of the default Python installation.
   Technically, the path of this version is stored inside the PATH environment variable where your OS will search for the executable when processing any command.
py.exe
   The command "py.exe" refers to the Python launcher, a utility thatâ€™s automatically installed into C:\Windows\ for any Python installation on Windows.
   All files in the Windows folder are accessible without needing to modify the PATH environment variable. 
   Thus, the Python launcher automatically delegates the work to the latest Python version installed in your environment. 
   However, you can also specify the used installation by means of a flag argument such as in py -3.6 to specify Python version 3.6.
